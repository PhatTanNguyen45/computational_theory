    "## Introduction and Context\n",
    "\n",
    "SHA-256 operates on **32-bit words** using bitwise operations. Unlike higher-level arithmetic, these operations manipulate individual bits using logical functions (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) and bit shifts/rotations.\n",
    "\n",

    "Cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256 require:\n",
    "- **Non-linearity**: Small input changes cause large, unpredictable output changes\n",
    "- **Diffusion**: Each input bit influences many output bits\n",
    "- **Confusion**: Complex relationship between input and output\n",

    "### The Integer Overflow Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's native `int` type has arbitrary precision, which means it can represent integers of any size. However, SHA-256 requires **exactly 32-bit unsigned integers** with wraparound behavior (modulo 2³²).\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Python int: no overflow\n",
    "x = 0xFFFFFFFF + 1  # Result: 4294967296 (requires 33 bits)\n",

    "### Solution: NumPy `uint32`\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **NumPy's `uint32`** type which automatically wraps at 2³² = 4,294,967,296. This gives us the exact behavior required by the SHA-256 specification.\n",

    "\n",
    "The constants are derived from **the fractional parts of cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers**. This approach serves several critical purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prevents backdoors**: Mathematical derivation ensures no hidden patterns or intentional weaknesses\n",
    "2. **Provides pseudo-randomness**: Fractional parts of irrational numbers behave randomly\n",
    "3. **Enables independent verification**: Anyone can compute and verify these constants\n",
    "4. **Maintains cryptographic tradition**: Similar methods used in MD5, SHA-1, and other standards\n",

    "# Problem 3 — SHA-256 Message Padding and Block Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction and Context  \n",
    "\n",
    "Message preprocessing is a critical phase in SHA-256 that transforms arbitrary-length input messages into fixed-size blocks suitable for the compression function. This process consists of two main components defined in **FIPS PUB 180-4**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Padding (Section 5.1.1)**: Ensures messages are properly formatted with deterministic length encoding\n",
    "2. **Parsing (Section 5.2.1)**: Divides padded messages into 512-bit blocks for processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Padding is Essential\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Deterministic processing**: All messages must produce predictable block structures\n",
    "- **Length preservation**: Original message length must be unambiguously encoded\n",
    "- **Collision resistance**: Different messages must never produce identical padded forms\n",
    "\n",

    "### Key Technical Achievements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standards Compliance**: Exact implementation of FIPS 180-4 specifications\n",
    "2. **Mathematical Precision**: Correct calculation of padding length k for all cases  \n",
    "3. **Generator Pattern**: Proper use of Python `yield` for memory-efficient block processing\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Mission Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this critical security analysis, we investigate three SHA-256 password hashes to expose vulnerabilities in naive password storage implementations. This problem demonstrates real-world cryptographic attacks and provides professional security recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "1. **Practical Cryptanalysis**: Recover original passwords from SHA-256 hashes using dictionary attacks\n",
    "2. **Security Methodology**: Understand how attackers exploit weak password storage practices\n",
    "3. **Professional Recommendations**: Propose industry-standard security improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 The Challenge: Three Compromised Password Hashes\n",
    "\n",
    "We have intercepted three SHA-256 hashes from a compromised system. These represent \"common passwords\" that were hashed using a **single pass of SHA-256** with **UTF-8 encoding** and **no salt**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Hashes:**\n",
    "1. `5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8`\n",

    "- **Avalanche Effect**: Single bit change causes ~50% output change\n",
    "- **Collision Resistant**: Extremely difficult to find different inputs with same hash\n",

    "\n",
    "### 📊 Attack Success Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The dictionary attack succeeded because the target system exhibited **three critical security flaws** that create a \"perfect storm\" of vulnerability:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Flaw #1: No Cryptographic Salt**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# VULNERABLE IMPLEMENTATION (what we just attacked):\n",
    "hash = SHA256(password.encode('utf-8'))\n",
    "\n",
    "# SECURE IMPLEMENTATION:\n",
    "salt = os.urandom(16)  # 128-bit cryptographically random salt\n",
    "hash = SHA256(salt + password.encode('utf-8'))\n",
    "# Store: (salt, hash) — salt can be stored in plaintext\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:**\n",
    "- All users with identical passwords have identical hashes\n",
    "- Enables **rainbow table attacks** (precomputed hash lookups)\n",
    "- Allows **batch attacks** where cracking one password reveals all instances\n",
    "- Violates **NIST SP 800-63B** requirement for unique salt per password\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Flaw #2: No Key Stretching (Computational Cost)**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# VULNERABLE: Single SHA-256 iteration\n",
    "hash = SHA256(salt + password)\n",
    "\n",
    "# SECURE: Intentionally slow key derivation\n",
    "hash = Argon2(password, salt, time_cost=3, memory_cost=65536, parallelism=4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Comparison:**\n",
    "| Method | Hashes/second | Attack Cost per Password |\n",
    "|--------|---------------|--------------------------|\n",
    "| **Single SHA-256** | 500,000,000 | $0.000001 |\n",
    "| **bcrypt (cost=12)** | 5 | $1.00 |  \n",
    "| **Argon2id (recommended)** | 2 | $2.50 |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Impact:** Attacker GPUs can test 8 billion SHA-256 passwords/second vs. 2 Argon2 passwords/second.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Flaw #3: Weak Password Policy**\n",
    "- No enforcement of password complexity\n",
    "- Users chose predictable dictionary words (\"password\", \"123456\")  \n",
    "- No checking against known breach databases\n",
    "- Lack of user education about password security\n",

    "### 📈 Implementation Timeline and Migration Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Phase 1: Immediate (Emergency Response)**\n",
    "1. **Audit Current System**: Identify all password storage implementations\n",
    "2. **Force Password Resets**: Require all users to choose new passwords  \n",
    "3. **Implement Temporary Rate Limiting**: Slow down ongoing attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Phase 2: Short Term (1-2 weeks)**\n",
    "1. **Deploy Argon2 Hashing**: Implement secure password storage\n",
    "2. **Enhanced Password Policy**: Implement breach checking and length requirements\n",
    "3. **User Education**: Inform users about password security best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Phase 3: Long Term (1-3 months)**\n",
    "1. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Roll out MFA for all accounts\n",
    "2. **Security Monitoring**: Implement automated threat detection\n",

    "### 🎯 Key Takeaways for Security Professionals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Never Use General-Purpose Hash Functions for Passwords**: SHA-256, SHA-512, and MD5 are designed for speed, not password security\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Salt + Key Stretching is Non-Negotiable**: Both components are required for basic password security\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Argon2 > bcrypt > scrypt >> SHA-256**: Use algorithms designed specifically for password hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Defense in Depth**: Combine strong hashing with MFA, rate limiting, and monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **User Education Matters**: Help users understand why password security matters and how to choose strong passwords\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔗 Professional Resources:**\n",
    "- **[OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)**: Comprehensive authentication security guidance\n",
    "- **[CWE-256: Unprotected Storage of Credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/256.html)**: Common vulnerability classification\n",
    "- **[Argon2 Specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9106.html)**: Technical details of recommended password hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚡ Bottom Line:** The attack succeeded not because SHA-256 is broken, but because it was misused for password storage. Proper implementation would have made this attack computationally infeasible.\n",
